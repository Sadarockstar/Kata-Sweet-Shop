# pics

This folder contains screenshots used by the frontend. Files:

- `admin.png` — screenshot of the admin dashboard / admin-only view.
- `cart.png` — screenshot of the shopping cart page.
- `home.png` — screenshot of the homepage / products listing.
- `login-admin-user.png` — screenshot of the login page when signing in as an admin (shows admin-specific UI elements).
- `login-normal-user.png` — screenshot of the login page for a normal user (non-admin).

If you add or replace screenshots, keep filenames the same so the `README.md` in the repo continues to render them correctly.
